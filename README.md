### This repo contains a list of projects proposed for Hacktober fest being organised by Google Developers Group on Campus: Bennett University
All these projects can be fairly complex in their architecture but to start with them, **you can pick `good first` issues which are meant for beginners.**
### Editing minor spelling/readme/typos in a project isin't considered a good contribution and is a bad practice, kindly avoid until you're refactoring entire documentaion of a project :)
